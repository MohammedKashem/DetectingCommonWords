 Advance Programming coursework: ==
 
 This program should be able to read in two text files and detect the most common words from file 1 and file 2
 and print them out on the console. There are some testing that I have left in but commented out, this was done
 to make sure the program works and no errors were found while implementing.
 
 The Binary Search tree method was used for efficency and to ensure that the words were stored and making sure it
 was processing the words correctly by detecting the words from file 1 and that appears the same in file 2 and
 then printing them out in a aphabetical order.
 
 Task Brief -
 
 1. First Argument is set for xxxx.txt that iÂ§s located on your system and that would be read
 in by an another argument
 
 2. Second Argument is that it reads the xxxx.txt and detects the most common words
 
 3. This stores the words and order them in sequence and prints the common words out, it converts all of the
 words to lower case.
 
 4. Error Checkings, if the file format is not regonised it will return a error, if one file is read in, it will
 return a error, if same files have been read in, it will also return a error.
 This ensure by reading in two different text files, the correct output of the common words is printed in order.
